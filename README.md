## Rails & Angular Products

We are going to build an application that will keep track of a set of Products. 

The front-end will be implemented in Angular and the back end will be implemented with Rails. 

The Angular files are served to the browser from Rails, asset pipleline. 

The front end will make remote requests to the backend JSON API to create, read update and delete products.

### Setup Angular in Rails

### Implement the front end and back end
